Odi and Ndey iot project

This Magic mirror module takes a room temperature reading using the Sense Hat attached to a Raspberry Pi.
With the Pi connected to the ThingSpeak MQTT broker, it publishes the temperature to a channel that Magic Mirror is subsribed to, updating the room temperature using the data entered in the channel field.
